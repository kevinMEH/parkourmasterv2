# Parkour Master v2

Parkour Master is a 2D platformer parkour game where you control Agent Purple and help him get to his objective.

Read what happened to v1 [here.](https://github.com/kevinMEH/parkourmaster)

All textures are made by me. Feel free to reuse in your own projects.

## [Play The Game Here](https://kevinmeh.github.io/parkourmasterv2)

NOTE: The browser version is different from the desktop version. For some reason, the gravity and speed is a bit off. I made adjustments to the HTML version, but it is not perfect.

## How to Play

**A & D** - Move left and right respectively

**Space** - Jump

**F** - Shoot

Don't let the slimes touch you!

Shoot the slimes to kill them. The slimes like to stoop low to avoid your bullets, so get in a tactical position and kill them.

Complete the parkour level and get to the floating island to win!

Tip: You can jump in midair.
